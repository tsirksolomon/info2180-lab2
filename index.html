            <h2>Test Tube is a Stubborn Character</h2>

                So earlier I said that I'm of the opinion that Test Tube has spent 
                most of the Inanimate Insanity series being the type of character 
                that can become stubborn and aggressive when she thinks she's in 
                the right and that it's one of her best and worst traits, and then 
                I also sort of joked about her being a hater. I wanted to compile 
                some scenes I thought illustrated that point. I thought it was 
                appropriate and a little silly to hae the first clip being from 
                Season 2, Episode 10, where upon seeing ghost Bow, she is so 
                distraught at the fact that she was incorrect about something that 
                she shatters. The idea of someone dying because they can't conceive 
                of being wrong sometimes is hilarious, but I also included it 
                because I think it's where the groundwork for the aforementioned 
                traits are first laid.(I will not be adding the video in this cut 
                for GitHub version of this entry).</p>

            <h2>Incessantly Chronicling Others' Behaviour</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-17 21:28" title="Posted at 21:32">Date: 2023 / 
                10 / 17</time>
            <p>(I also pulled this from a post I made elsewhere for the sake of
                having a paragraph.)
                <br>
                Imagine a hypothetical scenario wherein you participate in the
                third installment of a televised, survival-based competition, and
                part of your winning strategy is documenting the behaviour of the 
                other contestants and using that information to your advantage. 
                Keeping research on all sorts of other topics also happens to be 
                something you enjoy doing, so you have some information that may be 
                useful for the competition, but a lot more that is less likely to 
                be. Additionally, you need to document things because you have 
                problems with your memory, but the rest of the cast is unaware of 
                this. All of this data is with you at all times. Are other 
                contestants justified if they find your behaviour scary or 
                off-putting? If you trust a friend to hold on to some of this data
                and they break your trust by distributing it to other contestants 
                without asking you in a bid to get you eliminated, not because 
                you're a threat, but because they think you are a bad person, are
                they justified?
