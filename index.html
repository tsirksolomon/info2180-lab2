                    <p>(I pulled this from some of a post I made elsewhere for the sake of 
                        having a paragraph)<br>
                        So earlier I said that I'm of the opinion that Test Tube has spent 
                        most of the Inanimate Insanity series being the type of character 
                        that can become stubborn and aggressive when she thinks she's in 
                        the right and that it's one of her best and worst traits, and then 
                        I also sort of joked about her being a hater. I wanted to compile 
                        some scenes I thought illustrated that point. </p>
                    <p> I thought it was appropriate and a little silly to hae the first 
                        clip being from Season 2, Episode 10, where upon seeing ghost Bow, 
                        she is so distraught at the fact that she was incorrect about 
                        something that she shatters. The idea of someone dying because they 
                        can't conceive of being wrong sometimes is hilarious, but I also 
                        included it because I think it's where the groundwork for the 
                        aforementioned traits are first laid.(I will not be adding the 
                        video in this cut for GitHub version of this entry).</p>

                        <br>
                        Imagine a hypothetical scenario wherein you participate in the
                        third installment of a televised, survival-based competition, and
                        part of your winning strategy is documenting the behaviour of the 
                        other contestants and using that information to your advantage. 
                        Keeping research on all sorts of other topics also happens to be 
                        something you enjoy doing, so you have some information that may be 
                        useful for the competition, but a lot more that is less likely to 
                        be. Additionally, you need to document things because you have 
                        problems with your memory, but the rest of the cast is unaware of 
                        this. All of this data is with you at all times. </p>
                    <p> Are other contestants justified if they find your behaviour scary 
                        or off-putting? If you trust a friend to hold on to some of this 
                        data and they break your trust by distributing it to other 
                        contestants without asking you in a bid to get you eliminated, not 
                        because you're a threat, but because they think you are a bad 
                        person, are they justified? </p>
